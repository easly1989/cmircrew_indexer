# MirCrew Indexer Quality Assurance Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the phased quality assurance plan for the MirCrew Indexer project, covering code audits, bug fixes, improvements, and testing strategies.

## Phase 1 - Issue & Bug Resolution (Current)
**Objective:** Stabilize core functionality through comprehensive auditing and targeted fixes

### Scope:
- [x] Repository audit
- [x] Codebase scanning for:
  - [x] Syntax errors
  - [x] Type mismatches
  - [x] Configuration issues
  - [x] Security risks
- [x] Basic bug fixes
- [x] Engineering hygiene improvements
- [x] Documentation updates

### Completed:
- Syntax errors resolved in 5 core files
- Type annotations added to critical modules
- Env var validation strengthened
- Linting/formatting standardized
- README troubleshooting section updated

### Remaining:
- Complex BeautifulSoup typing in scraper.py
- 47 MyPy errors across 7 files
- Unit test coverage gaps

## Phase 2 - Enhancement & Testing
**Objective:** Improve reliability and maintainability through systematic enhancements

### Planned Work:
1. **Typing Improvements**
   - Complete type annotations
   - Resolve remaining MyPy errors
   - Add Pyright type checking

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Achieve 90% unit test coverage
   - Add integration tests for core workflows
   - Implement property-based testing

3. **HTML Parsing Improvements**
   - Refactor BeautifulSoup interactions
   - Create domain-specific parsing helpers
   - Add XML validation tests

4. **Performance Enhancements**
   - Profile scraping performance
   - Implement caching for frequent requests
   - Add connection pooling

5. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement input sanitization
   - Add rate limiting
   - Improve credential handling

## Phase 3 - Optimization & Monitoring
**Objective:** Ensure production-grade reliability and performance

### Planned Work:
- Error tracking
- Performance benchmarking
- CI/CD pipeline improvements
- Health monitoring
- Automated testing

## Tracking Progress
- Code comments with:
  - `FIXME: Phase2` for pending work
  - `TODO: Phase3` for future enhancements
- Commit messages:
  - `fix: [component] description` for bug fixes
  - `feat: [component] description` for enhancements
  - `docs: description` for documentation updates

## Contribution Process
1. Check `FIXME`/`TODO` comments
2. Create feature branch
3. Implement changes with tests
4. Submit changes for review
